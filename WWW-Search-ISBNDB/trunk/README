NAME
    WWW::Search::ISBNDB - Search for book information on isbndb.com

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This module creates an easy to use interface for searching books on
    isbndb.com.

      use WWW::Search;  
      my $search = WWW::Search->new('ISBNDB', key => 'abcd1234');
      $search->native_query("born in blood");
      while (my $result = $search->next_result() ) {
        print $result->{isbn}.' - '.$result->{book_id}, "\n";
        print $result->{title}.' - '.$result->url, "\n";
      }

DETAILS
  native_setup_search
    This prepares the search by checking for a valid developer key. A
    developer key can be obtained at isbndb.com and is free.

  native_retrieve_some
    The logic behind this module is very simple. First we prepare the search
    query that includes the access_key, search type, search value and
    display options and fetch the page with LWP::UserAgent. Once we have the
    results, we use XML::Simple to sift through them and populate a
    WWW::SearchResult object.

    Note that because of the complexity of the search result, it does not
    have all of the default WWW::SearchResult fields. The extra fields are
    contained within the object hash and consist of the following:

      book_id
      idbn
      language
      summary
      titlelong
      notes

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:
