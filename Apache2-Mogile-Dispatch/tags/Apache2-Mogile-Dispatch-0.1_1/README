Apache2-Mogile-Dispatch

Apache 2.x is an excellent platform for serving content, namely dynamic
content. Serving static content can become a gruesome task as your content
bank becomes bigger and more diverse. Thankfully we have distributed file
systems like MogileFS to easily distribute content efficiently while having
good and controllable redundancy.

Because really, who doesn't want redundancy?

This module also makes it easy* to migrate to MogileFS by calling a 'director'
with a few options and having it return a set of rules for
Apache2::Mogile::Dispatcher to follow. Currently the rules are based on the
hostname of the requested URI but could easily be modified to be based on
location specific rules.

To speed things up as much as possible this module makes use of
Cache::Memcached to cache as much of the decision information as possible.
