Apache2-Mogile-Dispatch

Apache2::Mogile::Dispatch is an apache 2.x mod_perl module that makes it easy
to dispatch incoming requests between mogile storage nodes and regular web
servers. Consider it like a fancy pure perl mod_rewrite replacement that can
intelligently reproxy requests.

This is ideal for websites that server a sizable amount of static content and
would like to transition to mogileFS.

The goal of this module is to be as small and simple as possible but flexible
enough for large websites to run efficiently and effectively. This module is
meant to up sub-classed and the default configuration will more than likely
NOT work. Please see the section on subclassing for more information. The test
suite also includes several example subclasses ranging from simple to complex.
