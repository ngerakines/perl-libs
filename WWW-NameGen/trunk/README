NAME
    WWW::NameGen - A website polling random name generator

SYNOPSIS
    This module polls an online name generator for x many random names,
    caches internally and returns the results.

      use WWW::NameGen;
      my $namegen = WWW::NameGen->new();
      my @names = $namegen->generate(min => 30);
      @morenames = $namegen->generate(min => 350);
      @evenmorenames = $namegen->generate(min => 350); # returns cached results as above

WHY
    You are probably thinking to yourself right now something like this:

      Why did he decided to get the list from a website instead of doing internal
      an internal sort of thing?

    There are a few reasons:

    I'm lazy
        I'm lazy and it was a quick hack for something more important than a
        random name generator.

    name lists are big
        I could of included the US Census data and done an internal sort and
        what-not but the data is over a meg and I don't want to deal with
        it.

    someone else already did it
        There are already a half dozen (more maybe?) modules that do all
        sorts of random word stuff from dictionaries and lists. This website
        has also already created a clean and simple random name generator.
        There is no point in me rewriting stuff that has already been done.
        See point "I'm lazy" for more information.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Creates and returns a new WWW::NameGen object.

  generate
    Performs the post request to get a random name list.

    This can take several arguments.

    min The 'min' value is the minimum count of random names to fetch.

    obscurity
        The 'obscurity' value is the obscurity of the names to fetch.

    type
        The 'type' argument is either 1, 2 or 3. One for only males, Two for
        only females, or Three for both males and females.

    nocache
        When the 'nocache' arg is set is will tell the generate function to
        ignore the cache and create a new set of names.

  get_chunks
    Takes a count breaks it into chunks of x.
