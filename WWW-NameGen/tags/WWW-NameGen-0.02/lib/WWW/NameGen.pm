=head1 NAME

WWW::NameGen - A website polling random name generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module polls an online name generator for x many random names, caches
internally and returns the results.

  use WWW::NameGen;
  my $namegen = WWW::NameGen->new();
  my @names = $namegen->generate(min => 30);
  @morenames = $namegen->generate(min => 350);
  @evenmorenames = $namegen->generate(min => 350); # returns cached results as above

=head1 WHY

You are probably thinking to yourself right now something like this:

  Why did he decided to get the list from a website instead of doing internal
  an internal sort of thing?

There are a few reasons: 

=over

=item I'm lazy

I'm lazy and it was a quick hack for something more important than a random
name generator.

=item name lists are big

I could of included the US Census data and done an internal sort and what-not
but the data is over a meg and I don't want to deal with it.

=item someone else already did it

There are already a half dozen (more maybe?) modules that do all sorts of
random word stuff from dictionaries and lists. This website has also already
created a clean and simple random name generator. There is no point in me
rewriting stuff that has already been done. See point "I'm lazy" for more
information.

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates and returns a new WWW::NameGen object.

=head2 generate

Performs the post request to get a random name list.

This can take several arguments.

=over

=item min

The 'min' value is the minimum count of random names to fetch.

=item obscurity

The 'obscurity' value is the obscurity of the names to fetch.

=item type

The 'type' argument is either 1, 2 or 3. One for only males, Two for only
females, or Three for both males and females.

=item nocache

When the 'nocache' arg is set is will tell the generate function to ignore the
cache and create a new set of names.

=back

=head2 get_chunks

Takes a count breaks it into chunks of x.
