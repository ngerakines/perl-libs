=head1 NAME

Net::Squid::Purge - Send purge requests to squid easily

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Allows you to send multiple purge requests to one or more squid servers
easily.

  use Net::Squid::Purge;
  my @squid_servers = (
    { host => '192.168.100.3' },
    { host => '192.168.100.4', port => '8080' },
  );
  my $purger = Net::Squid::Purge->new;
  $purger->squid_servers(\@squid_servers);
  $purger->purge('http://localhost/', 'http://localhost/home/');

=head1  How can I purge an object from my cache?

As taken directly from the squid docs:

A purge feature was added to Squid-1.1.6. It only allowed you to purge HTTP
objects until Squid-1.1.11. Squid does not allow you to purge objects unless
it is configured with access controls in squid.conf. First you must add
something like

  acl PURGE method purge
  acl localhost src 127.0.0.1
  http_access allow purge localhost
  http_access deny purge

The above only allows purge requests which come from the local host and denies
all other purge requests.

To purge an object, you can use the client program:

 squidclient -m PURGE http://www.miscreant.com/

If the purge was successful, you will see a '200 OK' response:

  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
  Date: Thu, 17 Jul 1997 16:03:32 GMT
  Server: Squid/1.1.14

If the object was not found in the cache, you will see a '404 Not Found'
response:

  HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
  Date: Thu, 17 Jul 1997 16:03:22 GMT
  Server: Squid/1.1.14
