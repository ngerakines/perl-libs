NAME
    WWW::Yahoo::KeywordExtractor - Get keywords from summary text via the
    Yahoo API

SYNOPSIS
    This module will submit content to the Yahoo keyword extractor API to
    return a list of relevant keywords.

      use WWW::Yahoo::KeywordExtractor;
      my $yke = WWW::Yahoo::KeywordExtractor->new();
      my $keywords = $yke->extract(content => 'My wife and I love to cook together. Carolyn surprises me with new things to love about her everyday.');
      print join q{}. 'Keyword 1: ', $keywords->[0], "\n";

SUBROUTINES/METHOD
  new
    The new subroutine creates and returns a WWW:Yahoo::KeywordExtractor
    object.

  extract
    This method will return a list of keywords based on sample data. It will
    die if there is no 'content' arg given.

CACHING
    This module will attempt to cache its data locally. It does this by
    creating content cache keys which are md5 hashes of content. Sooner or
    later I will update this module to also provide a list of content cache
    keys.
